# Heart-Disease-Prediction
I have used the following Machine Learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, K Neighbours Classifiers, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not.

Given some clinical parameters about a patient, we are predicting whether they have heart disease or not. We use the following Machine Learning algorithm:

 1.Logistic Regression
 2.K Neighbours Classifiers
 3.Support Vector Machine
 4.Naive Bayes
 5.Random Forest
